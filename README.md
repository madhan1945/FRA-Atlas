# 🌿 FRA Atlas & WebGIS Decision Support System

Backend Project | SIH 2025

A GIS-driven backend system designed to support the Forest Rights Act (FRA) implementation through data digitization, spatial visualization, and AI-assisted decision-making. The platform integrates WebGIS layers, FRA records, and asset-mapping intelligence to help authorities make accurate, real-time development and policy decisions.
